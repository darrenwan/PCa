class LogisticRegression(lm.LogisticRegression):
    """Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.

        In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR)
        scheme if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'ovr', and uses the cross-
        entropy loss if the 'multi_class' option is set to 'multinomial'.
        (Currently the 'multinomial' option is supported only by the 'lbfgs',
        'sag' and 'newton-cg' solvers.)

        This class implements regularized logistic regression using the
        'liblinear' library, 'newton-cg', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers. It can handle
        both dense and sparse input. Use C-ordered arrays or CSR matrices
        containing 64-bit floats for optimal performance; any other input format
        will be converted (and copied).

        The 'newton-cg', 'sag', and 'lbfgs' solvers support only L2 regularization
        with primal formulation. The 'liblinear' solver supports both L1 and L2
        regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.

        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        penalty : str, 'l1' or 'l2', default: 'l2'
            Used to specify the norm used in the penalization. The 'newton-cg',
            'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers support only l2 penalties.

            .. versionadded:: 0.19
               l1 penalty with SAGA solver (allowing 'multinomial' + L1)

        dual : bool, default: False
            Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for
            l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when
            n_samples > n_features.

        tol : float, default: 1e-4
            Tolerance for stopping criteria.

        C : float, default: 1.0
            Inverse of regularization strength; must be a positive float.
            Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger
            regularization.

        fit_intercept : bool, default: True
            Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be
            added to the decision function.

        intercept_scaling : float, default 1.
            Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used
            and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes
            [x, self.intercept_scaling],
            i.e. a "synthetic" feature with constant value equal to
            intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.
            The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.

            Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization
            as all other features.
            To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight
            (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.

        class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default: None
            Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
            If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.

            The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
            weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
            as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.

            Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
            through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

            .. versionadded:: 0.17
               *class_weight='balanced'*

        random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default: None
            The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling
            the data.  If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number
            generator; If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number
            generator; If None, the random number generator is the RandomState
            instance used by `np.random`. Used when ``solver`` == 'sag' or
            'liblinear'.

        solver : str, {'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', 'saga'}, \
                 default: 'liblinear'.

            Algorithm to use in the optimization problem.

            - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag' and
              'saga' are faster for large ones.
            - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'
              handle multinomial loss; 'liblinear' is limited to one-versus-rest
              schemes.
            - 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs' and 'sag' only handle L2 penalty, whereas
              'liblinear' and 'saga' handle L1 penalty.

            Note that 'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on
            features with approximately the same scale. You can
            preprocess the data with a scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.

            .. versionadded:: 0.17
               Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.
            .. versionadded:: 0.19
               SAGA solver.
            .. versionchanged:: 0.20
                Default will change from 'liblinear' to 'lbfgs' in 0.22.

        max_iter : int, default: 100
            Useful only for the newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers.
            Maximum number of iterations taken for the solvers to converge.

        multi_class : str, {'ovr', 'multinomial', 'auto'}, default: 'ovr'
            If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each
            label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit
            across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is
            binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.
            'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',
            and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.

            .. versionadded:: 0.18
               Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.
            .. versionchanged:: 0.20
                Default will change from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.

        verbose : int, default: 0
            For the liblinear and lbfgs solvers set verbose to any positive
            number for verbosity.

        warm_start : bool, default: False
            When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
            initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.
            Useless for liblinear solver. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

            .. versionadded:: 0.17
               *warm_start* to support *lbfgs*, *newton-cg*, *sag*, *saga* solvers.

        n_jobs : int or None, optional (default=None)
            Number of CPU cores used when parallelizing over classes if
            multi_class='ovr'". This parameter is ignored when the ``solver`` is
            set to 'liblinear' regardless of whether 'multi_class' is specified or
            not. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
            context. ``-1`` means using all processors.
            See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.

        Attributes
        ----------

        coef_ : array, shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)
            Coefficient of the features in the decision function.

            `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem is binary.
            In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `coef_` corresponds
            to outcome 1 (True) and `-coef_` corresponds to outcome 0 (False).

        intercept_ : array, shape (1,) or (n_classes,)
            Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.

            If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.
            `intercept_` is of shape (1,) when the given problem is binary.
            In particular, when `multi_class='multinomial'`, `intercept_`
            corresponds to outcome 1 (True) and `-intercept_` corresponds to
            outcome 0 (False).

        n_iter_ : array, shape (n_classes,) or (1, )
            Actual number of iterations for all classes. If binary or multinomial,
            it returns only 1 element. For liblinear solver, only the maximum
            number of iteration across all classes is given.

            .. versionchanged:: 0.20

                In SciPy <= 1.0.0 the number of lbfgs iterations may exceed
                ``max_iter``. ``n_iter_`` will now report at most ``max_iter``.

        Notes
        -----
        The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to
        select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon,
        to have slightly different results for the same input data. If
        that happens, try with a smaller tol parameter.

        Predict output may not match that of standalone liblinear in certain
        cases. See :ref:`differences from liblinear <liblinear_differences>`
        in the narrative documentation.
